# Face Identification Tool

The Face Identification Tool is a Python-based application that uses computer vision and machine learning to perform real-time face recognition and identification. This tool is designed for applications such as attendance tracking, access control, and user identification.

## Features

- Real-time face detection and recognition using OpenCV and face_recognition libraries.
- Integration with a MySQL database to retrieve and display student information.
- Text-to-speech functionality for reading out identified student information.
- Support for different modes of operation with corresponding mode images.
- User-friendly interface for displaying student details and images.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x +
- Required Python libraries: `OpenCV,` `face_recognition,` `mysql-connector-python,` `pyttsx3,` `cvzone` (Note: You may need to install additional libraries as well, depending on your setup.)

## Getting Started

1. Update

   ```sudo apt-get update```

2. Install updated Python
